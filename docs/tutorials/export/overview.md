# Model Export

EdgeLab currently supports the following model export methods. You can refer to the corresponding tutorials to complete the model export, and then put the exported model into deployment.

- [PyTorch to ONNX](./pytorch_2_onnx.md): Converts PyTorch model and `.pth` weights to ONNX model `.onnx`

- [PyTorch to TFLite](./pytorch_2_tflite.md): Converts PyTorch model and `.pth` weights to TFLite model `.tflite` 

::: tip

Before you can start exporting, you need to complete the [Training](../training/overview) section and obtain model weights `.pth` file before start exporting.
