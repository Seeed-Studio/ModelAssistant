    title: Anomaly Detection (coming soon)
    details: In the real world, anomalous data is often difficult to identify, and even if it can be identified, it requires a very high cost. The anomaly detection algorithm collects normal data in a low-cost way, and anything outside normal data is considered anomalous.
